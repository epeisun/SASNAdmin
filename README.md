[TODO]  
1. UI. Write a beautiful UI for it.  
2. FUNCTION. It should provide basic functions like these:  
        * Load Apply/upload configuration file (COM)  
        * show session/stats  
        * cmd input  
        * console output  
3. AUTH. This website should have a basic auth system which provides following functions:  
        * Log in
        * change user name/password

[Remark]  
1. We should have different roles. Different UI for different roles.  
2. We start server with admin.
